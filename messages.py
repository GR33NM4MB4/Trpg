intro = """
You wake up in a dark forest. Sore, bleeding, and
dizzy you stand up. You have no memory of how
you've gotten here. You step outside, and see a
path in front of you.
"""

end_level1 = """
After leaving the forest you follow a small path into
a farm town. Walking about the town, you see a
marketplace, and decide to steal an apple to sate your
hunger.
As you walk away eating the apple, a large
angry looking troll grabs you by the hair and throws
you to the ground. Not wanting to tempt fate, you run,
and come upon a cave entrance.
"""

end_level2 = """
Your eyes burn slighlty as you exit the cave into the sun.
Wiping the cobwebs and dirt from your clothes, you head
off towards the next town.
When approaching the gates, you encounter a man in a dark
cloak. His face is hidden, and he makes you uneasy.
'This town is a maze, and none who enter these gates emerge
from the other side.' The gates swing open.....
